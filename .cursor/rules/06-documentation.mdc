# Documentation Standards

## README Updates

- **MANDATORY**: Update `README.md` whenever a new feature is added to the application.
- New features must be documented in the "Features" section with a brief description.
- Include any new keyboard shortcuts in the "Keyboard shortcuts" section.
- Update screenshots if the UI changes significantly.
- Examples of features that require README updates:
  - New UI components (e.g., trigger nodes, source code dialog)
  - New functionality (e.g., workflow linting, trigger editing)
  - New file operations (e.g., export formats, import options)
  - New validation features
  - New keyboard shortcuts

## Feature Documentation Format

When documenting a new feature in the README:

1. Add a bullet point in the "Features" section describing what the feature does.
2. Keep descriptions concise but informative (1-2 sentences).
3. If the feature introduces new keyboard shortcuts, add them to the "Keyboard shortcuts" section.
4. If applicable, mention any dependencies or requirements.

## Examples

- ✅ **Trigger editing**: Visual trigger nodes with editable properties panel for configuring workflow triggers (push, pull_request, schedule, etc.).
- ✅ **Source code preview**: View and edit workflow YAML in a large dialog. Changes apply only when saved.
- ✅ **Workflow linting**: Automatic validation of workflow syntax, trigger names, job dependencies, and circular dependencies.

## Maintenance

- Keep the README up-to-date with the current state of the application.
- Remove references to deprecated features.
- Update version numbers or compatibility notes if relevant.
